      <h1>Website Evaluation</h1>
      <h5>
        Three sites I particularly like.
      </h5>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.localwisdom.com">Local Wisdom</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        "Local Wisdom" is a company that designs technology for other companies.
        Additionally, they work in both AR and VR and are primarily a design company.
        The colors of the site are bold, the layout is intriguing, and the animations are fantastic.
        The typeface fits and it communicates their message expertly.
        The load time isn't particularly long, and their mobile site works just as well.
        Specifically, the "about" section is incredible, you can get a look at the employees grouped based on not only department, but hobbies favorite foods, and even their pets.
        They are a design company so it makes sense that their site is as cool as it is, but it's still an incredible site and unlike I've seen before.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.coolmathgames.com">Cool Math Games</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        "Cool Math Games" was mostly included just for the nostalgia factor.
        Their purpose was to deliver flash games to all, which were particularly well received throughout elementary school.
        Their no nonsense approach brings you right to their page of games.
        The typeface fits, the color is easy on the eyes, and images give a quick preview of the games you're about to play.
        The navigation bar brings you right to the games you're most interested in.
        The layout presents the games to you in a list format, which gives you the perfect amount of games on the page at one time.
        Load time is great, especially considering each game takes a little bit to load after clicking on their links.
        What particularly interests me is the amount of games that have now been optimized for mobile.
        It's so cool to see games I used to play in elementary school now so easy to access on my phone.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.music-map.com/">Music-Map</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of "Music-Map" is to find artist that you might be interested in based on your favorite musicians.
        The site is simplistic and easy to use.
        When loading it up, all you see is a search bar for you to type the names of your favorite artists.
        The site offers an autofill function so that you know your artist is in the system.
        The typeface and colors are very simplistic, which really works for the site.
        There are no images.
        Upon typing in a favorite artist, the names of similar artists pop up and move around like bubbles.
        The closer the artist to yours, the more similar.
        Load time is fine and the mobile site works just as well as the desktop.
